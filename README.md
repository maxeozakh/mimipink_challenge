## mmmm

wanna create more and trash talking less so for 111 days i trying to spend time 

- more at growth as a programmer
    - practice is preferable to theory (projects/adventofcode/exercism)
    - as much as possible, **minimum 3 hours per day**, office hours a not included
- less at internet communications
    - messengers/chats/etc.
    - as less as possible, **max 1 hour per day**, except serious businisess that are not comfortable to do by calling
- start: 30/01/22 end: 21/05/22 or if `you died` happens
- if i fail the challenge i will raffle 111$ among friends ðŸ¤ª

## legend
 
- `red card` - do programming less than expected OR internet communications more than expected
- `you died` - 11 red cards
- `celestia` - run with streak more than 55
- `no death` - run without red cards == 111 streak

## stats

- day 24/111
- red cards: 0
- streak: 23
